============================================
Welcome to CoderDojoTC Java's documentation!
============================================
This documentation is for the CoderDojoTC Java project.  The purpose of this project is to learn how to
write appications using the Java programming language.  Initially we will be doing this using the libGDX
api.  This framework is great for writing croos platform games in Java.

Environment Setup
=================
To get started developing applications in Java there are a few tools you need to install and configure.  The
following sections will help in setting up your environment in order to start the libGDX tutorial.

You will need the following:
  * Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr2

    * An open source IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  This is what you will use to write your code,
    run your tests, and create your java application.

  * Android SDK (Software Development Kit) - https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

    * The Android development platform.  You will need this to create Android compatible applications

  * Java 8 SDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

    * This is the Java software development platform.  You need this to write Java applications

  * libgdx.jar - located in the tools directory

    * This is the version of the libGDX platform that we are using to develop java games.
