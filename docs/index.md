# CoderDojo Twin Cities Java Resources
This GitHub repository is for sharing teaching resources to teach Python. This includes hints on getting your Java environments setup up and lesson plans for serveral enviornments.

## Learning Java with Repl.it


## Target Audience
Learning Python is ideal for students that have good keyboarding skills.  If students have difficulty with doing functions like copy and pasting text we suggest they start with a block-programming language like Scratch.

## List of Concepts
Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course.  If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs.

- **importing libraries** We need to tell Pyhton what functions we want to use.  We will use the import function to tell Python which functions we need to use in our programs.
- **drawing** Turtle graphs has a set of drawing functions.  We will learn to use these to draw patterns on the screen.
- **square walk** - teach your turtle to walk in a square and draw figures.
- **variables** Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand.
- **loops** Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over.
- **conditionals** Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create.
- **functions**  Functions allow us to break large programs into chunks that we can give names and can call over and over.
- **function parameters**  Functions can also take parameters to change the behavior of a function.
- **random numbers**  Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers.
- **lists** Lists alow us to create collections of names.
- **inputs**  Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values.
- **recursion**  Recursion allows us to have programs call themselves to create repeating patterns.
- **modules**  Once you have a group of related functions you can put them all together into a module.  This makes it easier for others to reuse your programs.
