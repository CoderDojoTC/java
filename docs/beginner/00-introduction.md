# Introduction

## What you need to start

These labs assume that you have internet access and a modern web browser such as Chrome.

We use the [Repl.it web site](https://repl.it/) because it can compile and run Java applications.  Java is a compiled language and needs some tools installed to run locally.  This can be a challenge to get going, and so we will be able to instead use this web based tool which will get us started quickly.

## List of Java Learning Labs
For students that are new to programming, here are some sample programs (what we call learning labs) that you can try.

1. [Start with Objects](./01-objects.md) - introduction to Java Object Oriented language
2. [Variables](./02-variables.md) - Adding some variables
